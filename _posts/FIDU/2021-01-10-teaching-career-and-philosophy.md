This is the third time that I find myself putting together a learning portfolio. The first time was when I took <a href="https://ihworld.com/teach/become-a-language-teacher/formación-de-profesores-de-español/" target="_blank">**International House’s Spanish as a Foreign Language (SFL) Teacher Training course**</a>; the second time was on the occasion of <a href=" https://www.ub.edu/portal/web/educacion/masteres-universitarios/-/ensenyament/detallEnsenyament/1060507" target="_blank">**University of Barcelona and Pompeu Fabra University's joint master’s degree in SFL Teacher Training**</a>, which gave birth to this blog; and now I am writing these lines as a first-year Translation and Language Sciences Ph.D. student and, more specifically, in the context of University Pompeu Fabra’s Initial Training in University Teaching FIDU programme.

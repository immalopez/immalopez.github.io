This is the third time that I find myself putting together a learning portfolio. The first time was on the occasion of <a href="https://ihworld.com/teach/become-a-language-teacher/formación-de-profesores-de-español/" target="_blank">**International House’s Spanish as a Foreign Language (SFL) Teacher Training course**</a>; the second time was when I was doing <a href="https://www.ub.edu/portal/web/educacion/masteres-universitarios/-/ensenyament/detallEnsenyament/1060507" target="_blank">**University of Barcelona and Pompeu Fabra University's joint master’s degree in SFL Teacher Training**</a>, during which I created this very same blog; and now I am writing these lines as a first-year Translation and Language Sciences Ph. D. student and, more specifically, in the context of <a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/clik/formacio-inicial" target="_blank">**University Pompeu Fabra’s Initial Training in University Teaching FIDU programme**</a>.

This is the third time that I find myself putting together a learning portfolio. The first time was on the occasion of <a href="https://ihworld.com/teach/become-a-language-teacher/formación-de-profesores-de-español/" target="_blank">**International House’s Spanish as a Foreign Language (SFL) Teacher Training course**</a>; the second time was when I was doing <a href="https://www.ub.edu/portal/web/educacion/masteres-universitarios/-/ensenyament/detallEnsenyament/1060507" target="_blank">**University of Barcelona and Pompeu Fabra University's joint master’s degree in SFL Teacher Training**</a>, during which I created this very same blog; and now I am writing these lines as a first-year Translation and Language Sciences Ph. D. student at Pompeu Fabra University and, more specifically, in the context of <a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/clik/formacio-inicial" target="_blank">**their Initial Training in University Teaching (FIDU) programme**</a>.

In this post I will briefly discuss my teaching career and philosophy, in a similar fashion to that of <a href="https://immalopez.github.io/blog/punto-de-partida/" target="_blank">my previous portfolio’s starting point description</a>.

# My teaching career

# My teaching philosophy

Throughout these years, my conceptualisation of the teaching-learning process has remained essentially the same, if only more comprehensive and refined on account of my experience.

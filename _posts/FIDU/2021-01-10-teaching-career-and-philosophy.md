This is the third time <strike>(and hopefully the last)</strike> that I find myself putting together a learning portfolio. The first time was on the occasion of <a href="https://ihworld.com/teach/become-a-language-teacher/formación-de-profesores-de-español/" target="_blank">**International House’s Spanish as a Foreign Language (SFL) Teacher Training course**</a>; the second time was when I was doing <a href="https://www.ub.edu/portal/web/educacion/masteres-universitarios/-/ensenyament/detallEnsenyament/1060507" target="_blank">**University of Barcelona and Pompeu Fabra University's joint master’s degree in Linguistics Applied to the Teaching of SFL**</a>, during which I created this very same blog; and now I am writing these lines as a first-year Translation and Language Sciences Ph. D. student at Pompeu Fabra University — more specifically, in the context of <a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/clik/formacio-inicial" target="_blank">**their Initial Training in University Teaching (FIDU) programme**</a>.

With a considerably transparent name, the FIDU programme aims to provide basic teacher training to entry-level university staff. Its activities include solving online questionnaires on relevant topics (such as teaching and assessment methods or course plan design), recording and receiving feedback on a class of one’s own, and creating an e-portfolio. In this post, which constitutes the introductory document of such collection of learning evidence, I will briefly discuss my teaching career and philosophy, as well as my future goals as a university lecturer, in a similar fashion to that of <a href="https://immalopez.github.io/blog/punto-de-partida/" target="_blank">my previous portfolio’s starting point description</a>.

# My teaching career

Like that of every other nerd, my teaching career dates back to getting paid under the table as a teenager for well-intentioned but low-quality private lessons to classmates with difficulties. Officially, though, it started in 2017, when I took my first (baby) steps as a foreign language instructor in the private sector. Then, in December 2018, while doing my master’s degree, I was given the opportunity to teach a course at the university level. This was a truly remarkable experience, to the point that it helped me a great deal in choosing the academic path. From then on, I kept working as a freelancer and an Associate Professor at Pompeu Fabra University until I was awarded a Predoctoral Researcher contract to complete my Ph. D. studies. The exact details of said progression can be found in the mini CV below:

Having taught five different subjects — some of them twice already — I would say I have some experience with university education and can, as a consequence, identify key aspects in my teaching practice that need to be improved. Judging from student evaluations and my own perceptions as a lecturer, the things I struggle with the most are **giving feedback quickly** and **making highly theoretical lessons more digestible**. Hence, my objectives for this course are palliating these issues by trying to **optimise my grading time** (i.e., offer less detailed feedback and/or only on the most relevant mistakes) and introducing new methods, such as **problem-based learning**.

# My teaching philosophy

Throughout these years, my conceptualisation of the teaching-learning process has remained essentially the same, if only more comprehensive and refined on account of my experience.

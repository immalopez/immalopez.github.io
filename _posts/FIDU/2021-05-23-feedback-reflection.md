As I mentioned in <a href="https://immalopez.github.io/fidu/teaching-career-and-philosophy/" target="_blank">the first document of this learning portfolio</a>, one of the evaluable activities of the FIDU course consists in recording a class of ours so as to receive feedback from an expert — in this case, Judit Viñas, an educational psychology researcher — on aspects of our teaching that could be improved, as well as others that we should keep reinforcing. Therefore, today’s post is devoted to reviewing and reflecting on the tutor’s report and to outlining specific strategies to put into practice in the classroom accordingly.

In order to provide the reader with some context, the lesson I chose to record was from the Spanish Language (25285) subject for first year Translation and Interpreting students. In that particular instance, the goal was to introduce and get the pupils to start working on an assignment on semantic neology that they had to perform with a partner. More precisely, they were expected to adopt the role of a lexicographer and trace in the <a href="https://www.rae.es/banco-de-datos/corpes-xxi" target="_blank">**CORPES XXI**</a>, a corpus of current Spanish, neological uses of a series of proposed words. Before that, we also did a punctuation exercise.

Hello again! Today I am going to summarise and reflect on the theoretical contents of FIDU’s five online modules that seemed most relevant with respect to my professional development. While I will admit that my involvement with this aspect of the course could have been greater (I find it very hard to learn just by reading, so, albeit I was grateful for the short videos, mind maps, and questionnaires, following the modules felt more like a chore than anything else), it is my opinion that I acquired a non-negligible amount of knowledge, which I will try to prove below.


**1. Institutional Module**

Given that the context of Pompeu Fabra University is not new to me, as I have been both a student and a teacher in it, the Institutional Module is perhaps the one that had the least to offer. Most of the matters it addressed had to do with principles, procedures, bodies, organisations and useful services for an optimal experience studying and teaching within the institution, such as <a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/idiomesupf" target="_blank">**Idiomes UPF**</a>, that is, the university’s language school; the <a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/clik" target="_blank">**Centre for Learning Innovation and Knowledge (CLIK)**</a> itself, which is precisely the one granting us the chance to take the FIDU course, besides contributing many other formative materials like free webinars; or <a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/factoria" target="_blank">**La Factoria+**</a>, which provides both bibliographic and technological support (in fact, not long ago they helped me solve some doubts I had regarding intellectual property laws for data mining).

I think, nonetheless, that said module constitutes a much needed overview for newcomers, and I really enjoyed learning about the <a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/edvolucio" target="_blank">**EDvolució project**</a> and the <a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/clik/ajuts-placlik" target="_blank">**PlaCLIK initiative**</a>. I am even considering sending a proposal with my colleague Nico! It is undeniably positive to make this type of didactic tools, resources and incentives available to teachers, so that they maintain enthusiasm and creativity in the classroom. Especially when the pandemic started and we had to switch to online teaching, I believe the CLIK made a big effort to accompany lecturers not so well acquainted with technology (both in terms of hardware and software) and its associated instruction methods during the transition. This module also encouraged me to try out _Aula Global_'s (Moodle) **workshop component** for the first time in a **coevaluation** activity that went really well, so thank you!

**2. Learning and teaching in higher education**

While I was equipped with a solid didactic training thanks to my master’s degree and was thus already familiar with some of the concepts and theoretical frameworks laid out in this module, such as **the student-focused approach to teaching** or **Bloom’s taxonomy**, my intellectual baggage was not specifically focused on higher education. Therefore, I found this part of the course quite insightful, particularly as regards the distinction between **competencies** and **learning outcomes**, which, in spite of being notions present in almost every teaching plan, I had never seen formalised before.

I do not recall being previously exposed to Marton’s **surface and deep approach** terminology either, although the dichotomy it represents had been brought to my attention multiple times. In the same vein, I absolutely loved <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwslBPj8GgI" target="_blank">Eric Mazur’s video</a> – he is a great communicator who really manages to put into words a (not necessarily novice) teacher’s perplexity when things understandably do not go according to plan and/or their objective does not come across students as expected, while also providing practical advice to fix the problem.

However, the concept that I thought was the most useful is Bigg’s **constructive alignment**, because it helps systematise transversal coherence across the different dimensions of the teaching-learning process, something that I have been doing intuitively through <a href="https://immalopez.github.io/fidu/teaching-career-and-philosophy/" target="_blank">the questions outlined in my previous post</a>. On this subject, I intend to fully read Biggs and Tang’s _Teaching for Quality Learning at University_ this summer (of course, there were many other interesting references listed in the literature review document, but I have to be realistic with the time I have left to spare for this matter).

**3. Teaching methods in seminars, workshops, and master classes**
**4. Evaluating what we teach: assessment methods and tools**
**5. Course plan design**

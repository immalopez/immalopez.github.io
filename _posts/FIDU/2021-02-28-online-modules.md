Hello again! In this post I am going to summarise and reflect on the theoretical contents of the course’s five online modules that seemed most relevant with respect to my professional development.

Given that the context of Pompeu Fabra University is not new to me, as I have been both a student and a teacher in it, the **institutional module** is perhaps the one that had the least to offer me. Most of the matters it addressed had to do with principles, procedures, bodies, organisations and useful services for an optimal experience studying and teaching within the institution, such as <a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/idiomesupf" target="_blank">**Idiomes UPF**</a>, that is, the university’s language school; the <a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/clik" target="_blank">**Centre for Learning Innovation and Knowledge (CLIK)**</a> itself, which is precisely the one that grants us the chance to take the FIDU course, among many other things like free webinars; or <a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/factoria" target="_blank">**La Factoria+**</a>, which provides both bibliographic and technological support (in fact, not long ago they helped me solve some doubts I had regarding intellectual property laws when it comes to data mining).

I think, nonetheless, that said module constitutes a much needed overview for newcomers, and I really enjoyed learning about the <a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/edvolucio" target="_blank">**EDvolució project**</a> and the <a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/clik/ajuts-placlik" target="_blank">**PlaCLIK initiative**</a>. I am even considering sending a proposal with my colleague Nico! It is undeniably positive to make this type of didactic tools, resources and incentives available to teachers, so that they maintain enthusiasm and creativity in the classroom. Especially when the pandemic started and we had to switch to online teaching, I believe the CLIK made a big effort to accompany lecturers not so well acquainted with technology (both in terms of hardware and software) and its associated instruction methods through the transition.
